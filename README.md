### Test Assignment for PHP Developer

You are presented with actual (slightly worsened) code that need to be refacotred. We no longer work like this, and we want to ensure that you don’t either.

In the file `ReturnOperation.php`, you’ll find the code for one of internal API operations.

In the file `others.php`, there are the necessary functions and placeholder classes required for the operation to work.

**What needs to be done:**

- Identify and fix any potential errors (syntax, design, security, etc.) in `ReturnOperation.php`;
- Refactor `ReturnOperation.php` into what you believe is its best form;
- There’s no need to split `others.php` into separate files and namespaces;
- Write a brief summary in the comments: the purpose of the code, how much time you spent on the refactoring, and what you'd like to do with the original author of the code :)

**We provide this test assignment to:**

- Reduce the time spent on technical interviews - it’s better for you to spend a few hours in a calm home environment than to be nervous solving tasks under the scrutiny of our team;
- Increase the likelihood of passing the probation period - by seeing your coding style and quality upfront, we can be more confident in our choice;
- Decrease the number of short interviews where we reject candidates immediately.

We do not provide feedback on the results of the test assignment. If, in case of rejection, you would like our feedback on your test assignment, please mention this in your application.


**Solution** 

- The doOperation() method has too many responsibilities, I split the big function into smaller parts.
- I created  new services(ReturnOperationService, NotificationService.php) and moved the small functions there
- I created DTOs
- Created a new file(Constants.php) and moved all constants there
- we should ensure the method always returns the same type to prevent unexpected behavior
- Unnecessary casting and validation checks simplified
- Renamed the name of class(it more convenient to be the same as File name)
- there are some comments (please check it)


**Some notes**
- I didn't change something  in others.php, 
  but there are hard codes, that need to change for more dynamic code, 
  methods don't have return types,
  there are multiple classes that need to  split with different files, it make codes more readable. 
- The purpose of the code is to handle a notification operation related to product returns in a system 
  that manages transactions between resellers and clients
- I spent on this code approximately 2 Hours
- BTW I would love feedback regardless of the answer․
