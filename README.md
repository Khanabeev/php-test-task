### Dev comments

To check the execution of the app you need to run 
```
composer install
composer dump-autoload
php check.php 
```

In `others.php` I made only changes required to run this code
It took me ~2h 30m to do this task
As I understood this is a code that supposes to notify employees about good return operation changes.
It looks from this part of code that in this system clients has agreements and can file a complaint about goods and then initiate a return
